# Occult Teatime

## GB Studio Game Jam Project

Occult Teatime is a small game project created for the Action Button [Goblin Bunker Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/october-2024-goblin-bunker-game-jam) for October 2024 with the prompt "something in the mist".

Check out the game on Itch.io: [https://17shinsen.itch.io/middleware](https://17shinsen.itch.io/jam-mist-occultteatime)

The game is made with GB Studio.

### Objective of the game

Occult Teatime is a game about tea parties and classic folklore creatures. Select what to serve and serve in, wait for a creature to appear and see what they think of your choices.
